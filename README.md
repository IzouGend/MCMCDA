# MCMCDA
This repository contains matlab code for the paper "Markov Chain Monte Carlo Data Association for Multi-Target Tracking". This code is copied from the Internet.   

MCMCDA is a common-used multi-target tracking algorithm which is used for computer vision and radar signal processing. It has superior performance to traditional multi-target tracking algorithms such as JPDA(joint probablity data association) and MHT(multiple hypothesis tracking).
